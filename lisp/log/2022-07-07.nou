      * :symbol is actually short for KEYWORD:SYMBOL
        = The symbols in the KEYWORD package are automatically exported and their value is themself
      * #:foo is a notation for the reader.
        Gensym will create a new symbol every time it is evaluated,
        but sharp colon will only create a new symbol when it is read.
