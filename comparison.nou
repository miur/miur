ALSO:
  |aur/nav-git:| nav is a hackable ncurses file manager, inspired by vim, ranger, and dvtm.
  |aur/lf:| A terminal file manager, heavily inspired by ranger
  |aur/lscd-git:| file browser written in bash with an interface similar to ranger's

TODO:
  [_] github -- search 'filemanager', 'file manager', 'fm', etc
  [_] I need to read all the issues/pull-req on ranger/vifm
    => Because there may be contained some great vision
  [_] qutebrowser has nice discussions and ideas in Issues, like this
