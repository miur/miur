%%%% Debug facilities

generate complete graph of all connected *mods* in runtime
  E.G. file .gv/image, text outline, ascii art, gui graph/image preview
  + TRY:DEV: visualize animation of cmds traversing by graph (like electrons running)

monitor/statistics delays for cmds transferring/queues and cmds execution time

print own state and debug info directly inside its ifc by its cmds
  => so I can debug app problems by app itself
