  2D tree would be nice
  2.5D mindmap would be nice too
  2.5D papirus with visualized datastream pipelines and embedded video can be the best
  3D game reality would be explorative -- like may old Windows projects
  3D augmented reality can be interesting -- by e.g. looking through phone
  3D virtual reality may be something tangible
