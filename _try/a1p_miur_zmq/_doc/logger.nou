  [_] FIXME: must again setup logging.basicConfig() inside :/logger/ -- otherwise all location info is lost
  [_] TRY: send unformatted list of original objects to central logger before string interpolation
    => IDEA: achieve structured logging like with LTTng
  [_] TRY: also redirect all logging to LTTng trace

ARCH: thread-safety
  https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#logging-to-a-single-file-from-multiple-processes
    : logging is thread-safe, and logging to a single file from multiple threads in a single process is supported
  https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#network-logging
    : for multiprocessing -- gather all logs by SocketHandler and send to single server to write logs into file
  https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/384505/why-would-cpython-logging-use-a-lock-for-each-handler-rather-than-one-lock-per-l
    NICE: each handler uses its own Lock that it acquire and release at each logging call
