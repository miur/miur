IDEA:THINK: how to combine graph navigation tool with events structural logging
  i.e. weechat also isn't the best way to consume feeds in a unified way
    - system events
    - performance traces
    - im chats
    - news feeds
    - bash jokes
    - forums answers
    - web articles
  BUT! we NEED unified interface for streams -- to add dataflow processing
    and adding such thinks to weechat is truly awkward
