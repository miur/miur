IDEA
  * linux tools :: as small as possible
  * wayland design :: protocol as design core
    => impl is anything by others


Evolution
  * independent tools
  * maximum prototyping speed
  * use 'multiprocess' model for communication
    TODO:DEV: channel for events and channel for data
  * develop tools one at a time
    I can develop only what I'm interested right now and with a week timeframe at most
  * reuse already existing tools
    my strength is known tools and their application
  * split tools to lesser ones
    then some parts may be replaced by existing tools
  * in the end == replace glue by something robust
    glue may be replaced even in the process (E.G. bash -> python/lisp)


Mods
  ifc for graph navigation and operations submitting
    ? may it be two different mods ?
      + input may be used separately from output
      + replace only output or input module when rewriting
      - BUT: you need method to show current 'input' "selection" in 'output' module
        ? use socket to pass nodes, which require highlighting ?
        !!! 'input' requires *dom* for navigation, 'output' requires *dom* for displaying
          BAD if 'input' and 'output' are separate modules they must duplicate *dom* and regularly sync
          ALT shared *dom* on server, sending events to 'output' to refresh image
    HACK: try to embed into zsh, using smth similar to 'completion list' instead of ncurses
  preview current file under cursor
    pipe / colorize => catch output and return to 'output'
    gui image viewer => simply refresh currently viewed image
